   * Viral DNA
      1. think of a change you're making in your life and memories entangled with friends on Facebook
      2. change your Facebook password, split it into a # of pieces to meaningfully reflect your transformation
      3. check your timeline to see if any of the 9 friends there understand you in that manner
      4. permanently delete a post, reflecting the part of your identity you're about to change
      5. message your friends a piece of your password and ask them to "!!!codify their identity as yours" [{"the keys to your identity", "..."}]
      4. set your profile picture and enrich it socially as on this example -> facebook.com/blablaz
      5. comment your profile picture with a wild dream stemming from this change
