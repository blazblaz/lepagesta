# Not sure whether my assertions to this legal process were recorded, I am noting them here
- (16.12.2017, at home after dispute among my closest family peers)
I have stated that I support calling of the police, because I am in minority and I need a record of events, a transcription;
When pyschiatrist came, they said I am suffering from psychosis and that I ought to take antipsychotics - I refused then and I refused at all other occasions (noted later on) on basis that this unwanted event is not a product of perception diverging from reality;
Before I was taken to an examination at psychiatry Ljubljana Polje I stated that I am not taking responsibility for costs of process beyond a reasonable point;
Examination at psychiatry started with a statement that I have psychosis, furthermore, the receiving doctor told me, that my mother said she felt "threatened" and "misused". They would not take into account factual story surrounding this occasion;
Somehow, without being announced, this examination turned into something else, a containement. Having met closed unit's psychiatrist, I would hear that my psychosis needs to be treated with medicine and that I would be contained there, even after disclosing them with all facts I would have on my own situation (across two meetings). Psychiatrist would inflate any of my reactions going in the way of disagreement in combination of facial expressions of unease as aggressive.
