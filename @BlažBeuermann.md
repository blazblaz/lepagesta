# Noting some of happenings and assertions during this legal process (not sure if they were recorded)
- (16.12.2017, at home after dispute among my closest family peers)
I have stated that I support calling of the police, because I am in minority and because at home we don't use technology among ourselves to register important life events and because I need a record of events, a transcription.
When pyschiatrist came, they said I am suffering from psychosis and that I ought to take antipsychotics - I refused then and I refused at all other occasions (noted later on) on basis that this unwanted event is not a product of perception diverging from reality.
Before I was taken to an examination at psychiatry Ljubljana Polje I stated that I am not taking responsibility for costs of process beyond a reasonable point (I was here once before upon halucinations, without interevening into the process).

Examination at psychiatry started with a statement that I have psychosis, furthermore, the receiving doctor told me, that my mother said she felt "threatened" and "misused". They would not take into account factual story surrounding this occasion. Somehow, without being announced, this examination turned into something else, a containement. Having met closed unit's psychiatrist, I would hear that my psychosis needs to be treated with medicine and that I would be contained there, even after disclosing them with facts about my own situation (across several meetings). Psychiatrist would inflate any of my reactions going in the way of disagreement in combination of facial expressions of unease as aggressive (at first greeting me with "glad to meet you" and a mixed expression smile :])

I have met with a court expert (judge), transcriptor, a psychiatric expert and a lawyer. I would request if they would tell me what they have, but instead the judge said that she would be leading the process. I have told them again about the surrounding story, and how these actions were a mirror of the suppresed societal happening surrounding migrations, ignored outside and at home, and that I have applied a small amount of wrongdoings (domestic violence). Even though this was grounded in reason and actuality, I would still get a recommendation to take medicine for my psychosis (ungrounded at that point, without any halucinations or reasonable facts) - and all this even before the examining team would recognize what I am sacrificing with this, my past losses of my social network after medical treatment for psychosis and with my current opportunities and people waiting on me. Their decision did not come in yet.

Today, after finding out yesterday during a window of 15:00 - 16:45 online that I cannot use Facebook or Gmail to respond, I would skip lunch to see the psychiatric team leaving the office without calling me in (they called in most of the people there). Doctor said that we are waiting for the court's decision before starting treatment with medicine, which I would refuse and get forcefully imposed in my body. I have told my psychiatrist about my internet problem and about my losses, already having grounded that this is not a psychosis (also with my past record of such experiences, and my non-record of aggressive communication). They don't have reason to assume I would flee the country, and I could easily wait for this decision outside of the closed psychiatric environment.
After, I went to the techincs on the floor, asking if I could use my one phone call to call police - it would make more sense, as I am not experiencing psychosis. They told me that according to their internal code, I can only call relatives, not the police. They wanted to admit me to medicine (probably relaxants), because in interaction, which annoyed them before me, I appeared as unease.

My mother just came this moment and I am attending to her. She has been waiting for 15 minutes, while I have waited for her to start using technology for 15 years - easily avoiding this unpleasent situation.
