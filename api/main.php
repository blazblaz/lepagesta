/*
  With blockchain, any changes to data states are stored in the distributed database
  This API aims to emulate some core features a decentralized network of nodes running blockchain 

    * creating a data pool accessible accross many services the user chooses to share it with (this database isn't distributed, though)
    * maintaining proof for validity of data

  Doing so we keep in mind necessities of the blockchain paradigm shift, enabling a smoother passage onwards (trust in central authority's proper management is needed until processed data is signed by users as well as functions/objects dealing with it - without the possibility of tampering with internal states)

  Networks of brains and computer nodes are more aware when interacting to collaboratively shape a more complete, data driven picture
  A majority consensus on validity of data is needed for this to kick in, enabled by...

    * a process of collecting, storing and processing data that enjoys trust at both both ends, social and technological
    * trust in validity of data is based on a mathematical proof that is socially accepted (merkletree)
    * on the social end trust is enabled by a critical mass of ethical peers, beholding personal traits such as [{"value": {"honesty", "integrity", "responsibility"...}}]
    * based on a need from which changes sprout, adoption of a process is social proof of trust

  As such, this API aims to spark imagination, supporting transition of collective memories from conscious experiences into data blocks
